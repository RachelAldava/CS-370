SNHU’s CS-370 course was titled “Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science”. The content of this course involved researching and discussing different A.I. implementations as well as building our own neural networks. 
•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In the final project for CS-370, we were tasked with solving a pathfinding problem using deep-Q learning. Throughout the course, we created multiple kinds of neural networks, however in this project both the environment and the neural network construction were supplied within the starter code; this project focused specifically on deep-Q learning. The intelligent agent was tasked with completing a simple maze without attempting to move into a wall. After we solved the problem with one solution, we were asked to refine the training parameters in order to improve training time. In a later assignment, we built off of this project whenever we learned about the actor-critic algorithm.

•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science.
This course also involved a heavy research component. We were tasked with researching the current use-cases AI as well as constructing our own ideas. We also discussed the ethical concerns involved with AI. For example, one assignment concerned the European Union’s GDPR regulations and how we can design systems which are in compliance with that law. We discussed other ethical issues, such as sourcing training data appropriately.
Overall, this course improved my ability to research topics, empowered me with knowledge about neural networks and how I might construct one in a project, and strengthened my understanding of algorithmic solutions.
